This is a first attempt at a Flutter app for a photography business that I run.

## Purpose
The reason behind this app is to supliment my website and offer content on the go for clients. This will allow them to login and see their personal galleries that are fetched from an API specific to that person. They can also view basic about information of my company and have a contact form that will allow them to easily get in touch when needed. 

I want to also have a portfolio that can be viewed and eventually the ability to order images directly from the mobile application as well as from my website. 

These are just outlines that I am putting in place to learn Flutter and how it works. Whether or not this app ever sees actual use will depend on if I release it or not. This is more for learning purposes more than anything, and to have bragging rights of having a custom app. 

Eventually I want to create other useful apps but since I am inimately familiar with this business and have media that I can use to learn with flutter and make it look nice, it seemed like I good starting point.
