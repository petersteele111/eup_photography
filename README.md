# EUP Photography Mobile Application (Flutter Learning App)

This is a first attempt at a Flutter app for a photography business that I run.

## Purpose
This app is primarily to learn Flutter and to possibly create a working mobile application that my clients can use to log into their accounts and view their galleries. There will also be a portfolio feature to view some of my best images, as well as some about information and a contact form. I will use this app as a playground to have some fun and to learn important things needed to create more broadscope applications moving forward that can be enjoyed by many more.
